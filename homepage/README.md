!! Pull both the .env and yaml file, run `docker-compose up -d` and it should start right up. Just need to make sure the .env file is filled out for all the integrations to work properly. Some I could never get setup in the .env to work so I had to hardcode passwords/tokens/secrets, etc. into the actual services.yaml instead of using .env just fyi
